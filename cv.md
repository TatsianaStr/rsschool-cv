**About me**
Determined and enthusiastic about learning and working. In the past, I curated the site of the school museum and became interested in web development. During my studies at IT-Academy, I independently implemented several educational projects: website [“Spices of the world”](https://tatsianastr.github.io/spiceofworld/) and two browser games. I actively continue to gain practical experience online: I participate in marathons, webinars (workshop from Glo Academy “Writing youtube in JS”, ​​development of a browser game in pure JS, JS Marathon PRO Edition: working on an rpg online game in JS and Canvas). I have good understanding and teamwork skills.\
I have a level of **English B2**, a level of **Polish A2** and continue to improve my knowledge with mentors.\
